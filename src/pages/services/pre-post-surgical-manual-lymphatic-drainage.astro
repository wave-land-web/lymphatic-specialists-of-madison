        >Post-surgical manual lymphatic drainage</a
      > helps clear out excess lymph fluid caused by surgical trauma, which assists in faster healing
      and pain reduction. Scar tissue work is also performed when appropriate to help reduce adhesions
      after surgery which will help with overall appearance of surgical site and surrounding areas, increased
      lymphatic flow and help reduce future scar adhesion complications. Indicated for cosmetic surgeries,
      orthopedic surgeries, non-elective emergency/non-emergency surgeries, gender affirming surgeries.
      Schedule this type of work if you are 0-6 months post op.

          What Is Pre/Post-Surgical Manual Lymphatic Drainage?
        </h2>
        <div class="prose">
          <p class="lsa lsa-slide-up no-repeat">
            Pre/Post-surgical Manual Lymphatic Drainage is a gentle yet powerful form of bodywork
            that is intended to stimulate and encourage the natural movement of the lymph, which
            carries waste products away from the tissues back towards the heart. It is a technique
            based on gentle, rhythmic and constant movements that mimic the rhythm of the body's
            lymphatic system. During a post-surgical manual lymphatic drainage session, the
            therapist gently massages the lymph nodes and then guides post surgical edema towards
            those correlating lymph nodes.
          </p>
          <p class="h4 lsa lsa-slide-up no-repeat">
            Post-surgical Manual Lymphatic Drainage is NOT deep tissue massage. MLD should NEVER
            hurt to receive. MLD is also NOT opening up incision wounds to push edema out of the
            body.

          <p class="text-accent-content lsa lsa-slide-up no-repeat">
            Oftentimes after surgery, the body will swell with excessive edema both at and proximal
            to the surgical site. This post-operative swelling, while completely normal, can be
            quite uncomfortable. Sluggishness, decreased range of motion, increased sensitivity,
            inability to sleep comfortably, and an overall feeling of puffiness can often occur
            during the surgical recovery process.

          <p class="text-accent-content lsa lsa-slide-up no-repeat">
            Reducing post-surgical swelling is one of the most common ways that Manual Lymphatic
            Drainage is used. Because of its ability to directly move excessive post-surgical edema
            while using the most gentle of touch, Manual Lymphatic Drainage is frequently regarded
            as an imperative part of the surgical recovery process by surgeons worldwide.

            Fibrosis is a build up of scar tissue that can occur as a result of cosmetic surgery
            which can cause lumps and bumps in the subdermal tissues.

            It can sometimes be found in the lateral torso, lower abdomen, and back after
            liposuction. While this consequence of liposuction is not ideal, not to worry. Fibrosis
            can be treated!
          </p>
          <p class="text-primary-content lsa lsa-slide-up no-repeat">
            Through various techniques, fibrosis and scar tissue can be gently treated causing any
            lumps and bumps that may have settled during the recovery process to get smoothed out.
            Using warm oil and lymphatic cupping, myofascial decompression allows for scarring and
            edema build-up to gently be reduced allowing the patient to feel more comfortable and
            confident in their new body.
