                    Hi, I'm Courtney. I am a physical therapist who specializes in Post-Surgical
                    manual lymphatic drainage, manual lymphatic drainage for chronic health
                    conditions and scar tissue work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I am extremely passionate about what I do and helping guide my patients towards
                    their goals with compassion, patience and an understanding of the complexities
                    of each individual's health journey. I am 100% patient focused, which means I
                    will ALWAYS do what is best for my patients.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I received my Bachelor of Science in Dance from the University of
                    Wisconsin-Madison in 2006 and taught dance for 10 years after graduating.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2016 I graduated from Texas State University with my doctorate in Physical
                    Therapy. My first few years working as a Physical Therapist I was working
                    primarily with high level athletes and chronic pain patients with a focus on
                    movement re-education and manual work honing my skills as a hands on
                    practitioner and learning soft tissue work and scar tissue manipulation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2018 I received my Manual Lymphatic Drainage certification (CMLDT) from the
                    Klose Institute in Seattle, Washington and began working full time as a manual
                    lymphatic drainage specialist and have been doing that for the past 6 years. I
                    love working with and have experience with all sorts of post-surgical patients
                    including: breast augmentation/lift/reduction, abdominoplasty, BBL, DIEP flap,
                    mastectomy, top surgery, face/neck lift, liposuction, leg/arm/360 lifts, skin
                    removal, orthopedic surgeries and any other elective or non elective surgery. I
                    also love and have worked with patients with: lipedema, lymphedema, cancer,
                    autoimmune, long covid, Lyme and any other chronic inflammatory conditions.
                    While working with patients I use a mix of manual lymphatic drainage, scar
                    tissue work, visceral work, breath work and soft tissue work as needed to assure
                    you are getting the best outcomes as possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At Madison Lymphatics and Bodywork, my focus is on helping people recovering
                    from surgery, cancer and supporting those with lymphatic, autoimmune conditions
                    or chronic inflammation issues. I often refer out to other practitioners in the
                    community and enjoy working as a team with other members of the health community
                    for a truly holistic approach to patient care. I enjoy working in this capacity
                    because it hones in on my love for critical thinking and helping people find the
                    right direction for complex medical issues.

                  <p>
                    In my other professional life, I own an IG vintage shop. In my free time I enjoy
                    seeing live music, spending time with friends and family, exploring nature and
                    hanging out with my partner Chris and our dog Lefty.

                  <p>
                    Hi, I'm Sarah. I'm a Licensed Massage Therapist and Bodyworker who believes
                    massage is for every body. I am deeply committed to my clients and strive to
                    create a welcoming, affirming and nurturing environment where we can work
                    together on a personalized approach and treatment plan to get you feeling your
                    best. As a life-long student, I love learning and researching individual
                    conditions to facilitate healing in the immediate session, and to promote
                    life-long wellness through client education.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An avid traveler with boundless curiosity, I graduated from the Costa Rica
                    School of Massage Therapy (CRSMT). Surrounded by natural beauty, this immersive,
                    accelerated, rigorous program was situated in a barefoot, outdoor classroom
                    setting, promoting deep and holistic levels of study and healing. Before
                    embarking on a career as a massage therapist and bodyworker, I built a career at
                    national non-profits focused on health and wellbeing, social responsibility, and
                    environmental activism. My work concentrated on the fields of diversity, equity
                    and inclusion, training and leadership development, and talent management. These
                    passions were supported by my undergraduate degree from UW-Madison in
                    Anthropology and Spanish, and my MBA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I value how the power of massage and bodywork can change lives. I enjoy
                    exploring different modalities to address client concerns and aim to create the
                    afterglow effect in every single session- the light or radiance that remains;
                    the euphoric feeling that lingers after a beautiful experience. My clients
                    describe me as thoughtful, genuine, warm, and creative. I'm grateful for the
                    opportunity to hold space and restore balance for those who entrust me with
                    their care.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When I'm not at the studio you can find me traveling around the world, doing all
                    the outdoorsy things, cooking up new recipes, reading, designing, relearning
                    piano, getting handy with home renovations, playing with my sewing machine,
                    fostering rescue pups into loving homes, and supporting causes I believe in.

                    Shaina Scott began her career in the health field after graduating from East
                    West Healing Arts Institute's massage therapy program in July of 2006. She was
                    exposed to many different modalities of care in her schooling and became
                    interested in both Ayurveda and Chinese Medicine. She then went on to study
                    Ayurvedic medicine, Panchakarma treatments and yoga at the Greens Ayur Hospital,
                    in Kerala, India, from February-May 2008. She has also attended several births
                    to provide massage therapy support during labor. She has worked expansively with
                    people recovering from injuries, athletes, and celebrates people from all walks
                    of life. She is passionate about the benefits of acupuncture and massage therapy
                    and feels they should be accessible modalities for everyone.

                  <p>
                    Shaina's commitment to quality care has led her to studying many different forms
                    of healing including intuitive dowsing and energy work such as reiki. Shaina was
                    first introduced to the benefits of reiki as a teenager when she obtained her
                    first reiki 1 certification. Later she felt the calling to further those studies
                    and began studying reiki again in 2015. She became a Reiki Master Practioner by
                    February 2018. She then went on to begin studying Acupuncture and Chinese
                    Medicine in September of 2018. Shaina graduated Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelor
                    of Science in Nutrition and Masters in Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine in
                    November of 2022.

                  <p>
                    Shaina is passionate about empowering her patients with the skills and knowledge
                    needed to take their health into their own hands and become an active
                    participant in their healing journey. She has seen the many benefits of
                    acupuncture for a variety of different health concerns whether it is injury
                    recovery, chronic pain management, mental or emotional issues, insomnia and many
                    other ailments.

                    In her free time, Shaina enjoys spending quality time with her son, time in

                    excited to be offering her services to the community and helping to improve the

            Our clinic focuses on and is known for providing MLD, post-op care and therapeutic
            massage, so our patient's needs vary greatly. We regularly treat patients with:

            chronic conditions and generalized inflammation. Being comfortable with treating
            patients from a holistic perspective and being a part of their care team is an essential
            part of the job. Additional requirements include excellent communications skills, a warm
            disposition, and the ability to work well with our group of dedicated therapists.
