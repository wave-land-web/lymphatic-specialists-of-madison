            <p class="text-shadow-lg lsa lsa-slide-up delay-200 no-repeat">
              We always focus on the patient's individual needs, analyzing a number of different
              aspects of their health, to see how Manual Lymphatic Drainage or Therapeutic Massage
              would be most beneficial. We believe that educating our patients on their lymphatic
              imbalances and what may be causing it is imperative to recovery and health.

            <p class="text-shadow-lg lsa lsa-slide-up delay-300 no-repeat">
              Our practitioners are graduates of nationally accredited schools and have thorough
              knowledge of the lymphatic system, anatomy, physiology, kinesiology, and an
              understanding of how it all works together.

              Before each treatment, we do a full intake with the patient asking questions that will
              help formulate a session designed for optimal results. We never do pre-choreographed
              routines and continually strive to provide our patients with unique treatments that
              produce the desired outcome.

              Our practitioners at Madison Lymphatics and Manual Therapy use the Vodder Method in
              Manual Lymphatic Drainage sessions. Modalities that may be used during a typical
              massage therapy session include Myofascial Release, Trigger Point Therapy, Deep Tissue
              Massage, Swedish Massage and Cranio-Sacral Therapy.

            Now imagine an acute injury or trauma like a sprained ankle - this looks like turning
            the shower water off and putting the bathtub water on full blast for a short period of
            time. Let's say 20 mins. There is standing water but eventually your body (the bathtub
            drains) are able to move this excess fluid through, leaving no standing water after a
            couple of days.

            stream forever. There is always a small amount of standing water in the bathtub because this
            stream is always larger than the amount of shower water and your drains can only handle the
            amount of water produced when the shower is turned on.

            Now imagine lymphedema, which can be from lymph node removal, trauma, radiation or scar
            tissue. This is like taking away some of the drains. There is no excess water, just not
            enough drains to allow for no standing water.

            Lymph is a by-product of blood flow. With inflammation, we have more blood flow and then

          We imagine a cylindrical vase filled half way with water and start adding in your
          individual inflammatory factors into the vase. We begin to see symptoms of inflammation
          when the vase overflows.
        </p>
        <p class="lsa lsa-slide-up no-repeat">
          For example, if you have an autoimmune disease (this would be a boulder), have a
          sensitivity to gluten (pebble) and a close relative just passed away (rock), this could be
          enough to tip the water over the edge. We often make referrals to other professionals that
          can help manage your pebbles, rocks and boulders so we can focus on what we do, which is
          treat the overflow of inflammation (i.e. lymphatic fluid) that we see.
