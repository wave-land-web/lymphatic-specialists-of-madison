                <p class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                  Every day, about 20 liters of plasma (the liquid part of your blood) flow out of
                  tiny pores in the thin walls of your capillaries. Imagine water seeping out of a
                  sponge. Where does this liquid go? It delivers oxygen and nutrients to the tissues
                  surrounding each capillary. The tissues hungrily soak up all the nutrients while
                  leaving behind waste (like a kid who finishes their food but leaves behind a pile
                  of sticky napkins).
                </p>
                <p class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                  The plasma doesn't mind cleaning up the mess — it picks up the waste and then
                  returns to your bloodstream the same way it came, by flowing back through the
                  pores in your capillary walls. Each day, about 17 liters of plasma return to your
                  bloodstream in this way. Since 20 liters initially flowed out of your capillary
                  walls, that means 3 liters are still roaming around in your body's tissues.
                </p>
                <p class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                  That's where your lymphatic system steps in. Tiny lymphatic capillaries pick up
                  this remaining fluid from your tissues. The fluid changed its name during its
                  journey: it's called lymph. Your lymphatic capillaries move the lymph into larger
                  tubes called lymphatic vessels.
                </p>
                <p class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                  These vessels keep the lymph moving until it ultimately reaches one of two major
                  ducts in your upper chest. These are called your right lymphatic duct and thoracic
                  duct, and they're a bit like highway on-ramps. They merge into large veins called
                  your subclavian veins and empty the lymph into them. From there, your lymph
                  reenters your bloodstream and can flow through your body again.

                    Imagine your lymph system as a bathtub shower.

                  <li class="group-hover:text-base-100">Your lymph fluid is shower water.</li>

                  <li class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                    Your lymph nodes are the drain (imagine a hair catcher on top of the drain so
                    lots of little holes).
                  </li>
                  <li class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                    In a normal healthy lymph system - water from the shower comes out as fast as it
                    goes down the drain leaving no standing water behind.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                  Now imagine an acute injury or trauma like a sprained ankle (in the health field,
                  acute means there is a beginning and an end) — this looks like letting the shower
                  water run, but also turning on the bathtub water at the same time. The amount of
                  time and intensity at which the bathtub water turns on varies based on the acute
                  trauma, but it is more than normal. Now there is standing water, but hopefully and
                  usually eventually, your body's lymph nodes (the bathtub drains) can move this
                  excess fluid through, leaving no standing water after a couple of days. Sometimes
                  this doesn't happen, and that's where we step in - to help move along that excess
                  fluid back into the drain!
                </p>
                <p class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                  <strong class="group-hover:text-base-100"
                    >Now imagine chronic inflammation, like in the case of an autoimmune disease.</strong

                </p>
                <p class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                  This leaves a constant amount of standing water in the bathtub because this amount
                  is always larger than the amount of shower water (the amount your body is
                  programmed to manage), and your drains can only handle the amount of water
                  produced from the shower water. Our job is not to let that standing water
                  accumulate on the bottom of the bathtub, but to chip away at it each session to
                  get your body in a more manageable, functional, and optimal place.
                </p>
                <p class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                  Now imagine lymphedema, which can be from lymph node removal, trauma, radiation,
                  or scar tissue. This is like taking away some of the drains. There is no excess
                  water, just not enough drains to allow the water to go down the drain without any
                  issues.

                </p>
                <p class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                  Lymph is a by-product of blood flow. With inflammation, we have more blood flow
                  and then more lymph. Therefore, inflammation affects the lymphatic system.
                </p>
                <p class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                  Possible causes of inflammation (although it is different for everyone):
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                    Diet: eating foods that create an inflammatory/allergic response to, or eating
                    too little/too much.
                  </li>
                  <li class="group-hover:text-base-100">Exercise: too little or too much.</li>
                  <li class="group-hover:text-base-100">Hormone imbalance.</li>
                  <li class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                    Genetics: having a predisposition to something like an autoimmune disease.
                  </li>
                  <li class="group-hover:text-base-100">Acute or chronic stress.</li>
                  <li class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                    High Cortisol levels (caused often by chronic stress).
                  </li>
                  <li class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                    Environment: allergens or sensitivities.

                <p class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                  We look at all of the above factors that could play a role in excess inflammation
                  and then assign them as either a pebble, a rock, or a boulder, and decide which
                  variables are contributing to your particular situation and which variables can be
                  changed, and which cannot.
                </p>
                <p class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                  We imagine a cylindrical vase filled halfway with water, and start adding in your
                  inflammatory factors into the vase. We begin to SEE/FEEL symptoms of excess
                  inflammation when the vase overflows.
                </p>
                <p class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                  For example, if you have an autoimmune disease (this would be a boulder), have a
                  sensitivity to gluten (pebble), and a close relative just passed away (rock), this
                  could be enough to tip the water over the edge. This is where the
                  interdisciplinary, holistic approach to patient care comes in. We often make
                  referrals to other professionals who can help address your changeable pebbles,
                  rocks, and boulders, so we can focus on what we specialize in, which is to treat
                  the overflow of inflammation (i.e., lymphatic fluid) that we see.

                  give you privacy to undress, and you will be covered with a sheet and blanket at
                  all times except the area being worked on.

                  Manual lymphatic drainage massage is best performed while the patient is fully
                  undressed, as restrictive clothing and elastic bands can obstruct good lymphatic
                  flow. That said, you will always be covered with a sheet or towel during the
                  session.

                  Massage and MLD can be profoundly relaxing, affecting all your bodies systems.
                  Give yourself a moment to reorient before slowly getting up. After an initial
                  period of feeling slowed down, people often experience an increase in energy that
                  can last for several days.

                  With Manual Lymphatic Drainage Massage, it's not uncommon for people to feel a
                  number of symptoms associated with moving excess inflammation, which can look like
                  a feeling of general malaise, such as headache, or feeling tired. Sometimes you
                  may not feel dramatic results right away. Watch for changes over the following
                  days, such as pain relief, decreased swelling, increased mobility, or reduced
                  stress.

                  Scar tissue mobilization/remodeling can sometimes be painful for a number of
                  reasons — one is significant scar tissue, as is often seen after surgery or a big
                  trauma needs more aggressive remodeling as the scar tissue is often large and can
                  be deep. If done too gently, we will not get the same results and likely will not
                  prevent adhesions from forming.

                <p class="group-hover:text-base-100">
                  Two, scars can often entrap superficial or deep nerves. Mobilizing the scar tissue
                  helps with freeing up the nerves, but it can feel very sharp or have a burning
                  sensation while performing the scar tissue work. This is normal and needs to be
                  worked through in order to untangle the nerve from the scar tissue.

                  No. Receiving manual lymphatic drainage massage or scar tissue work while battling
                  a cold or influenza is never a good idea. Not only can you easily spread illness
                  to your practitioner (who is seeing several other clients per day), but you can
                  also exacerbate your symptoms by receiving manual work.
