            <input type="radio" name="faq-accordion" />

            <div class="collapse-content">
              <div class="prose prose-sm max-w-none text-base-content/80">
                <p>
                  Every day, about 20 liters of plasma (the liquid part of your blood) flow out of
                  tiny pores in the thin walls of your capillaries. Imagine water seeping out of a
                  sponge. Where does this liquid go? It delivers oxygen and nutrients to the tissues
                  surrounding each capillary. The tissues hungrily soak up all the nutrients while
                  leaving behind waste (like a kid who finishes their food but leaves behind a pile
                  of sticky napkins).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The plasma doesn't mind cleaning up the mess â€” it picks up the waste and then
                  returns to your bloodstream the same way it came, by flowing back through the
                  pores in your capillary walls. Each day, about 17 liters of plasma return to your
                  bloodstream in this way. Since 20 liters initially flowed out of your capillary
                  walls, that means 3 liters are still roaming around in your body's tissues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That's where your lymphatic system steps in. Tiny lymphatic capillaries pick up
                  this remaining fluid from your tissues. The fluid changed its name during its
                  journey: now instead of plasma, it's called lymph. Your lymphatic capillaries move
                  the lymph into larger tubes called lymphatic vessels.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These vessels keep the lymph moving until it ultimately reaches one of two major
                  ducts in your upper chest. These are called your right lymphatic duct and thoracic
                  duct, and they're a bit like highway on-ramps. They merge into large veins called
                  your subclavian veins and empty the lymph into them. From there, your lymph
                  reenters your bloodstream and can flow through your body again.

                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Imagine your lymph system as a bathtub shower.</li>
                  <li>Your lymph fluid is shower water.</li>
                  <li>Your body is the tub.</li>
                  <li>
                    Your lymph nodes are the drain (imaging lots of little drains - not one big
                    one).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In a normal healthy lymph system - water from the shower comes out as fast as it
                    goes down the drain leaving no standing water behind.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Now imagine an acute injury or trauma like a sprained ankle - this looks like
                  turning the shower water off and putting the bathtub water on full blast for a
                  short period of time. Let's say 20 mins. There is standing water but eventually
                  your body (the bathtub drains) are able to move this excess fluid through, leaving
                  no standing water after a couple of days.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Imagine chronic inflammation, like in the case of an autoimmune disease. This
                  looks like turning the shower water off and putting the bathtub water on a slow
                  steady stream forever. There is always a small amount of standing water in the
                  bathtub because this stream is always larger than the amount of shower water and
                  your drains can only handle the amount of water produced when the shower is turned
                  on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now imagine lymphedema, which can be from lymph node removal, trauma, radiation or
                  scar tissue. This is like taking away some of the drains. There is no excess
                  water, just not enough drains to allow for no standing water.
                </p>
                <p><strong>What causes inflammation?</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Lymph is a by-product of blood flow. With inflammation, we have more blood flow
                  and then more lymph. Therefore, inflammation affects the lymphatic system.
                </p>
                <p>Possible causes of inflammation (although it is different for everyone):</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Diet: eating foods that create an inflammatory/allergic response to or eating
                    too little/too much.
                  </li>
                  <li>Exercise: too little or too much.</li>
                  <li>Hormone imbalance.</li>
                  <li>
                    Genetics: having a predisposition to something like an autoimmune disease.
                  </li>
                  <li>Acute or chronic stress.</li>
                  <li>High Cortisol levels, (caused often by chronic stress).</li>
                  <li>Environment: allergens or sensitivities.</li>
                  <li>Acute trauma like an ankle sprain.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  We look at all of the above factors that could play a role in inflammation and
                  then assign them as either a pebble, rock or boulder.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We imagine a cylindrical vase filled half way with water and start adding in your
                  individual inflammatory factors into the vase. We begin to see symptoms of
                  inflammation when the vase overflows.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, if you have an autoimmune disease (this would be a boulder), have a
                  sensitivity to gluten (pebble) and a close relative just passed away (rock), this
                  could be enough to tip the water over the edge. We often make referrals to other
                  professionals that can help manage your pebbles, rocks and boulders so we can
                  focus on what we do, which is treat the overflow of inflammation (i.e. lymphatic
                  fluid) that we see.

                  Depending on the primary technique your practitioner uses, you may or may not need
                  to fully undress. For a full body therapeutic massage, most people undress
                  completely. However, you may choose to wear underwear. Your massage therapist will
                  give you privacy to undress, and you will be covered with a sheet and blanket at
                  all times except the area being worked on.

                  Manual lymphatic drainage is best performed while the patient is fully undressed,

                  said, you will always be covered with a sheet or towel during the session.

                  Massage and MLD can be profoundly relaxing, affecting all your bodies systems.
                  Give yourself a moment to reorient before slowly getting up. After an initial
                  period of feeling slowed down, people often experience an increase in energy that
                  can last for several days.

                <p>
                  With Manual Lymphatic Drainage, it's not uncommon for people to feel a number of
                  symptoms associated with removing inflammation causing/toxins such as headache, or
                  feeling tired. Sometimes you may not feel dramatic results right away. Watch for
                  changes over the following days, such as pain relief, increased mobility, or
                  reduced stress.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because lymphatic fluid is released through urination, it's not uncommon for
                  people to find themselves in the bathroom more frequently after a MLD appointment.

                <p>
                  You might be more sensitive in certain areas, but it shouldn't hurt. Acupuncture
                  needles are usually not painful on areas of thicker skin and muscles. For example,
                  your belly and back are less sensitive. Certain points like your hands and feet
                  might be more sensitive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you feel pain, tell your acupuncturist. They'll adjust the needles or choose
                  other points. Their goal is not to make you feel pain. They will position you
                  properly and make sure you feel comfortable so that you can relax during your
                  session.

                  No. Receiving massage therapy or manual lymphatic drainage while battling a cold
                  or influenza is never a good idea. Not only can you easily spread illness to your
                  practitioner (who is seeing several other clients per day), but you can also
                  exasperate your symptoms by receiving massage.

                  Also, if you are currently taking antibiotics for an infection, you will be

                  patients.

                  While it is not an obligation to give your practitioner a gratuity, it is always
                  appreciated. Gratuities can be given at the time of payment or, if you care to be
                  more discrete, can be left in the treatment room for your practitioner after the
                  session.

                  If you looking for an different way to show appreciation for your practitioner,
                  leaving a positive review online or referring a friend to our clinic is a great
                  alternative to tipping.
