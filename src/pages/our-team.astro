                <p>
                  I am a physical therapist who specializes in Post-Surgical manual lymphatic
                  drainage, manual lymphatic drainage massage for chronic health conditions, and
                  scar tissue work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am extremely passionate about what I do and helping guide my patients towards
                  their goals with compassion, patience, and an understanding of the complexities of
                  each individual's health journey. I am 100% patient-focused, which means I will
                  ALWAYS do what is best for my patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I received my Bachelor of Science in Dance from the University of
                  Wisconsin-Madison in 2006 and taught dance for 10 years after graduating.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2016, I graduated from Texas State University with my doctorate in Physical
                  Therapy. In my first few years working as a Physical Therapist, I was working
                  primarily with high-level athletes and chronic pain patients with a focus on
                  movement re-education and manual work, honing my skills as a hands-on practitioner
                  and learning soft tissue work and scar tissue manipulation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2018, I received my Manual Lymphatic Drainage Massage certification (CMLDT)
                  from the Klose Institute in Seattle, Washington, and began working full-time as a
                  manual lymphatic drainage massage specialist, and have been doing that for the
                  past 7 years. I love working with and have experience with all sorts of
                  post-surgical patients, including: breast augmentation/lift/reduction,
                  abdominoplasty, BBL, DIEP flap, mastectomy, top surgery, face/neck lift,
                  liposuction, leg/arm/360 lifts, skin removal, orthopedic surgeries, and any other
                  elective or non-elective surgery. I also love and have extensive experience
                  working with patients living with: lipedema, lymphedema, cancer, autoimmune, long
                  covid, Lyme, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, POTS, MCAS, and any other chronic
                  inflammatory conditions. While working with patients, I use a mix of manual
                  lymphatic drainage massage, scar tissue work, visceral work, breath work, and soft
                  tissue work as needed to assure you are getting the best outcomes as possible.
                </p>
                <p class="h3">
                  At Lymphatic Specialists of Madison, my focus is on helping people recovering from
                  surgery, cancer, and supporting those with lymphatic, autoimmune conditions, or
                  chronic inflammation issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I often refer to other practitioners in the community and enjoy working as a team
                  with other members of the health community for a truly holistic approach to
                  patient care. I enjoy working in this capacity because it engages my love for
                  critical thinking and helping people find the right direction for complex medical
                  issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In my other professional life, I own an IG vintage shop. In my free time, I enjoy
                  seeing live music, spending time with friends and family, exploring nature, and
                  hanging out with my partner Chris and our dog Lefty.

                <p class="h3">Hello, I'm Anna.</p>
                <p>
                  I'm an occupational therapist with nearly 10 years of experience helping adults
                  live their lives to the fullestâ€”no matter their circumstances. I have worked
                  across a variety of rehab settings, including hospitals, home health, and nursing
                  homes, and I am a certified neurology specialist and certified dementia
                  practitioner.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in 4 1/2 years from Concordia
                  University Wisconsin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the years, I've developed a special passion for lymphatic drainage massage
                  and edema management. My interest began early in my training when I saw the
                  remarkable difference an OT made in her patients' lives through lymphatic work.
                  Since then, I've pursued extensive continuing education in lymphatic drainage,
                  lymphedema and lipedema management, as well as compression techniquesâ€”all with the
                  goal of improving comfort, mobility, and independence for my patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My approach is patient-centered and collaborative. I meet each person where they
                  are, tailoring treatment plans to their unique goals and needs, and ensuring they
                  feel comfortable and supported throughout the process. I also emphasize
                  educationâ€”empowering patients with the tools and knowledge to manage their
                  conditions independently, long after discharge.
                </p>
                <p class="h3">
                  For me, great care means working as a teamâ€”patient, therapist, and other
                  providersâ€”to create the best possible outcomes. I am committed to giving my very
                  best so that every patient I serve feels confident, cared for, and capable of
                  living life to the fullest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In my spare time, I love going to concerts, spending time outside, playing with
                  and getting cuddles from my dog, Meeko, and trying new foods and exploring new
                  places with my significant other, Kabeer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I look forward to partnering with you on your journey to better health and
                  well-being.

                <p>
                  I am a licensed occupational therapist with 16 years of experience treating
                  patient populations across the lifespan living with persistent pain due to a
                  variety of health challenges and medical conditions. Drawing from my previous
                  background in massage therapy and social work, I utilize a wholistic approach
                  while collaborating with patients to determine a plan of care based on the unique
                  needs of each individual client. I am committed to building strong partnerships
                  with my patients offering personalized manual therapy and pain management
                  strategies to support pain reduction, management of swelling and inflammation,
                  enhanced mobility and support overall well-being.
                </p>
                <p class="h3">
                  My interest and passion for lymphatics comes from seeing how functionally
                  debilitating living with medical conditions that result in persistent inflammation
                  and swelling may be for an individual as well as an overall lack of effective
                  treatment options across healthcare environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I developed a strong desire and commitment to learn effective treatment
                  interventions for people experiencing lymphatic dysfunction and partner with
                  community healthcare providers who share a similar vision to improve patient
                  outcomes. I pursued additional manual therapy training in the areas of Manual
                  Lymphatic Drainage, Myofascial Trigger Point Release, Scar Massage, and
                  Craniosacral Therapy to enhance my abilities to help patients find relief and
                  return to meaningful activities. I received my Manual Lymphatic Drainage Massage
                  certification (CMLDT) from the Klose Institute in Lafayette, CO in 2025.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After earning my Master's of Occupational Therapy degree from the University of
                  New Mexico in 2008, I relocated to Chicago to join the interdisciplinary pain
                  management team at the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab, Center for Pain Management,
                  formally known as the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. I have presented
                  lectures and conducted workshops nationally and internationally on the role of
                  occupational therapy in the treatment of pain management. Additionally, I pursued
                  specialized training in the areas of pain neuroscience education, graded motor
                  imagery, pain reprocessing therapy, functional desensitization,
                  ergonomic/environmental assessment, pacing training, postural/body mechanics,
                  sensory integration methods, Mindfulness and adaptive movement-based therapies
                  including Yoga, QiGong, and Tai Chi. Prior to becoming an occupational therapist,
                  I provided case management services to support individuals living with chronic
                  mental health and substance use challenges in a variety of diverse settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My family and I recently relocated to the Madison area as we are long-time lovers
                  of the Driftless region. Beyond my work, I find fulfillment in hiking, yoga,
                  horseback riding, cooking, gardening and spending time with family and friends.
