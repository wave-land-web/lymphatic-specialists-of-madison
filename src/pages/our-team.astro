                <p class="h3">Hi, I'm Courtney.</p>
                <p>
                  I am a physical therapist who specializes in Post-Surgical manual lymphatic
                  drainage, manual lymphatic drainage for chronic health conditions, and scar tissue
                  work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am extremely passionate about what I do and helping guide my patients towards
                  their goals with compassion, patience, and an understanding of the complexities of
                  each individual's health journey. I am 100% patient-focused, which means I will
                  ALWAYS do what is best for my patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I received my Bachelor of Science in Dance from the University of
                  Wisconsin-Madison in 2006 and taught dance for 10 years after graduating.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2016, I graduated from Texas State University with my doctorate in Physical
                  Therapy. In my first few years working as a Physical Therapist, I was working
                  primarily with high-level athletes and chronic pain patients with a focus on
                  movement re-education and manual work, honing my skills as a hands-on practitioner
                  and learning soft tissue work and scar tissue manipulation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2018, I received my Manual Lymphatic Drainage certification (CMLDT) from the
                  Klose Institute in Seattle, Washington, and began working full-time as a manual
                  lymphatic drainage specialist, and have been doing that for the past 7 years. I
                  love working with and have experience with all sorts of post-surgical patients,
                  including: breast augmentation/lift/reduction, abdominoplasty, BBL, DIEP flap,
                  mastectomy, top surgery, face/neck lift, liposuction, leg/arm/360 lifts, skin
                  removal, orthopedic surgeries, and any other elective or non-elective surgery. I
                  also love and have extensive experience working with patients living with:
                  lipedema, lymphedema, cancer, autoimmune, long covid, Lyme, Ehlers-Danlos
                  syndrome, POTS, MCAS, and any other chronic inflammatory conditions. While working
                  with patients, I use a mix of manual lymphatic drainage, scar tissue work,
                  visceral work, breath work, and soft tissue work as needed to assure you are
                  getting the best outcomes as possible.
                </p>
                <p class="h3">
                  At Lymphatic Specialists of Madison, my focus is on helping people recovering from
                  surgery, cancer, and supporting those with lymphatic, autoimmune conditions, or
                  chronic inflammation issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I often refer to other practitioners in the community and enjoy working as a team
                  with other members of the health community for a truly holistic approach to
                  patient care. I enjoy working in this capacity because it engages my love for
                  critical thinking and helping people find the right direction for complex medical
                  issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In my other professional life, I own an IG vintage shop. In my free time, I enjoy
                  seeing live music, spending time with friends and family, exploring nature, and
                  hanging out with my partner Chris and our dog Lefty.
